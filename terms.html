                <li>In the case of an adopt or custom, you must have the original artist and/or designer's permission to redesign the Auralym, and you must follow that artist's redesign TOS, if they have one, along with the following rules:</li>
                 <ul>
                   <li>Redesigns must keep all traits of the previous Masterlist design. The redesign must resemble the original by at least 80%. (80% is visually subjective. Go with your gut here people)</li>
                   <li>The only exception to the above is if you have the specific redesign shop item.</li>

                <li>These rules are in place to keep the original design from becoming unrecognizable, and to try and protect the original artists intentions.
