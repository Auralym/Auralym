        	<!--text-->
        	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Ashmarks and their History</b></p>
        	<p>Lanternals are naturally soot-stained! Think of it as a natural pigmentation of their skin. However, they can mark their limbs with Ashmarks through magic. Ashmarks adorn limbs, and like the rings on a tree, the general rule of thumb is that the more a Lanternal has, the older they are. They are a physical representation of their magic. Ashmarks used to be ceremonial markings that could denote anything from family status, age, personal vows, to power. If a Lanternal no longer wishes to be marked, they can burn away the markings, at the cost of losing that portion of magic.</p>
        	<p>Lanternals used to be secret from humanity, simply guiding (or misleading) travelers at night. As fae creatures, they are extremely free-spirited. However, a couple hundred years ago, some humans discovered the secret to magically binding a Lanternal inside an object or to a location. Bound Lanternals were then used as sources of illumination- as torchlights, as lamps, within lighthouses, etc. A bound Lanternal was usually controlled through their Ashmarks, since they are a visual, external representation of their power.</p>
        	<p>It wasn’t until they found a way to break the magical bindings that Lanternals began keeping Ashmarks again. Some Lanternals have reclaimed Ashmarks for their original decorative and ceremonial purposes, while others reject them. This is a highly debated topic among Lanternals.</p>
         	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Binding</b></p>
        	<p>Humans can temporarily “bind” or “tether” a Lanternal to an object or location if they have visible ashmarks. However, the talisman or ritual fades on its own given time, or the Lanternal can instantly escape by burning away their markings.</p>
        	<p>Though the origins of the spells are lost to time, some believe this magic was learned by humans in an attempt to harness a Lanternal’s light, in a superstitious bid for good luck, or perhaps as a way to get even with a trickster Lanternal who caused harm.</p>
        	<p>Lanternals are not bound by human laws of size and shape, and therefore will fit quite easily as a wisp form in containers ranging from glass jars to massive lighthouses.</p>
     	 
        	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Cores & Flames</b></p>
        	<p>Most Lanternals are creatures of fire.</p>
        	<p>The fire is supernatural in quality, but whether it has the normal properties of fire is entirely up to the individual. Lanternals can touch objects with their fire safely, or they can choose to ignite something.</p>
        	<p>Most cores sit in the exposed rib cage. Cores outside the rib cage are considered an <b>extremely rare </b>trait. This is because the rib cage is the safest place for their core. Only the oldest, strongest, or most confident lanternals keep it outside the protective shield of bones.</p>
        	<p>It’s normal for their core to strengthen or even dim, according to the Lanternal’s will or mood. Their core can be extinguished, which would be painful and uncomfortable for the Lanternal, but they would survive. Weaker Lanternals would be extinguished by water, while magically stronger ones can keep their core lit despite the water. As they are beings of magic, they can reignite their core, but it takes a long time, a large amount of magic, and leaves them diminished and tired for years. If they run out of magic, or if they’re too tired to reignite their ashen core, they could die. Therefore, it’s very rare to see the core being exposed and vulnerable.</p>
       	 
          	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Kemonomimi Features</b></p>
        	<p>Lanternals have mammalian features because they’re creatures of the forest, and they adopt the features that they see regularly! They cannot change their features later in life- the ones they first develop are there to stay. Younger Lanternals would not survive water, and therefore are never exposed to it long enough to adopt aquatic features.</p>
        	<p>When it comes to cores made from other elements: freak occurrences! Lanternals are usually fire based, but they’re still elemental beings, so it’s pretty much a random chance for their magic to present as a material other than fire. Some joke that perhaps it’s Polaris playing a cruel prank when crafting a Lanternal with an ice or water core.</p>

        	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Voids</b></p>
        	<p>Perhaps the most notable trait of a Grim is their void. Contrary to the Lanternal's core, the Grim's ribs hold an empty vessel. Without something to contain their magic, it often overflows from the void. This magic, aptly named Ichor, reflects the color of a Grim’s magic- their soul.</p>
        	<p>If it goes beyond the point of simply overflowing, the ichor may bleed into their skin, creating marks similar to a human’s tattoos or Lanternal’s ashmarks. They’re known as voidmarks, a reminder of the power they hide within the dark. The magic can be used and drained, leaving the skin bare as if never void-touched to start.</p>
        	<p>Some Grim believe the more voidmarks you have the more magic overall and therefore the more powerful you are, but others note that perhaps the magic simply hasn't been reabsorbed and are quick to call the Grim in question lazy.</p>
        	<p>When a Grim is particularly powerful, though, the void in their chest can spread, unable to house their magic any longer. It can corrupt their tails, horns, wings, or even limbs, making them into emergency magic vessels. These are the Grim considered blessed- or cursed- by Leviathan.</p>
         	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Aquatic Features</b></p>
        	<p>Grimhalla are crafted by Leviathan beneath the waves, and therefore only capable of having aquatic features. The one exception is those that are a bit more similar to a lizard or other reptilian, but standard mammalian traits are never found amongst Grim.</p>
        	<p>Every Grim is born with at least one tail to help them navigate their environment. The deeper the water they’re born in, the more likely it is that they’ll be found with an extra tail or patch of void soon after creation.</p>

        	<p>The oldest and most powerful Lanternals became gods- they became the stars themselves. The most prominent is <b>Polaris,</b> the North Star. Polaris has been guiding travelers for generations, serving as a bright beacon to any lost soul. It is for this reason that many Lanternals worship her. Some believe that Polaris was the first Lanternal- others argue that she <em>created</em> the rest.</p>
        	<p>No one knows for sure, since Polaris has never confirmed one way or the other.</p>
        	<p>Star-born Lanternals are <b>extremely rare</b> and powerful compared to their normal brethren.</p>
        	<p>Some star-born Lanternals spend their time on earth, collapsing their star to a small point, and others stick to the sky where they appear as regular members of the constellations.</p>
         	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Grimhalla</b></p>
        	<p>The Grimhalla of Valdivia are born of <b>Leviathan,</b> ancient ocean-dwelling god of the abyss. For as long as the oldest Grim can remember Leviathan has been trapped in the deepest parts of the sea, inaccessible to all but the most powerful of Grim- void-coated and essentially gods themselves.</p>
        	<p>Some tell stories of Grim who vanished into the deep and were able to return home to Leviathan. It's somewhat of a cautionary tale. While the Lanternals long for the stars and the attention of Polaris, the Grim know it's best to avoid Leviathan's gaze.</p>
        	<p>There must be a reason he’s been bound beneath the waves, after all.</p>
        	<p>The appearance of excess void is seen as a mark of divinity and extremely rare, but many Grim are quicker to call it a curse.</p>

        	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Lanternals</b></p>
        	<p><b>Grimhalla:</b> Young Lanternals tend to have at least some hesitation towards Grimhalla. They’re mysterious creatures of the deep sea, born of a dark god, and completely unpredictable. For an elemental creature of the stars, it’s a rather concerning description. Still, older Lanternals tend to know better than scary bedtime stories.</p>
        	<p><b>Humans:</b> Lanternals used to be secret from humanity, simply guiding (or misleading) travelers at night. As fae creatures, they are extremely free-spirited. However, a couple hundred years ago, some humans discovered the secret to magically binding a Lanternal inside an object or to a location. Bound Lanternals were then used as sources of illumination- as torchlights, as lamps, within lighthouses, etc. During this time, many unbound Lanternals burned away their markings, sacrificing power for safety.*</p>
        	<p><b>* see IMPORTANT NOTE below</b></p>
     	 
         	<p class="text-center" style="letter-spacing:2px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 3000;"><b>Grimhalla</b></p>
       	<p><b>Lanternals:</b> While this obviously varies from Grim to Grim, the Grimhalla as a concept aren’t too fond of Lanternals. Old Grim texts describe Polaris and Leviathan as ancient rivals, and they tend to blame Polaris for their god being eternally trapped beneath the sea.</p>
        	<p><b>Humans:</b> The Grim’s relationship with humans isn’t well recorded. They join Lanternals in books of legends and myths with very little proof of their existence. Throughout time, the Grim have inspired some classic tales such as the mermaid and kraken. Generally, if there’s a story of a terrible monster at sea, it’s likely to be traced to a Grim or their god.</p>
        	<hr>
        	<p><b>*IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Lanternals as a species have prominent themes of cages, magic, and fae trickery. Binding is the act of their personal magic being inverted or twisted to be tied to one place. This can be broken by the Lanternal in question. I heavily discourage using this lore to imply anything untoward, weird, racist, etc. and violators will be given a strike. A lanternal temporarily bound to the top of a christmas tree /= slavery.</p>

        	<p>Some Grim believe the more voidmarks you have the more magic overall and therefore the more powerful you are, but others note that perhaps the magic simply hasn't been reabsorbed and are quick to call the Grim in question lazy.</p>
        	<p>When a Grim is particularly powerful, though, the void in their chest can spread, unable to house their magic any longer. It can corrupt their tails, horns, wings, or even limbs, making them into emergency magic vessels. These are the Grim considered blessed- or cursed- by Leviathan.</p>

        	<p>Grimhalla are crafted by Leviathan beneath the waves, and therefore only capable of having aquatic features. The one exception is those that are a bit more similar to a lizard or other reptilian, but standard mammalian traits are never found amongst Grim.</p>
        	<p>Every Grim is born with at least one tail to help them navigate their environment. The deeper the water they’re born in, the more likely it is that they’ll be found with an extra tail or patch of void soon after creation.</p>
